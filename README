Welcome to Yousifs 4001 Assignment 3

Step 1: give permission to script file

Step 2: type in ./consumer and ./producer in respective terminals

(note: it odes not matter which one you enter first, consumer will wait for producer and producer will write until consumer reads)

step 3: enjoy your new TEXT_OUT.txt file 

(note: I made a test copy of what the producer reads and writes, you can change the text of the TEST_IN to whatever you like!)
